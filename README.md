# Information Plane of Representation Learning

The mutual information provides a potent tool for visualizing learning process by displaying a trajectory on the two-dimensional plane of I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y), called Information Plane. In this project, we implemented Information Plane in various types of autoencoders with kernel-based estimation. IP trajectory changes depending on the type and architecture of autoencoders, and the extistence of compression phase, a key issue in Information Plane analyses, also differs. IP patterns of each AE are consistent across different image data (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST).
